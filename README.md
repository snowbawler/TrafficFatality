## Description

This project combines data from NASA and the city of Austin to determine relationships between moon phases, the day of the week, and traffic fatalities.

## Goals

The goal of this project is to determine relationships between the moon phases, days of the week and traffic fatalities in Austin, Texas.

## Data

### [Moon Phase Data](/MoonPhases/moon_phase_all.txt)

Moon Phase Data contain moon phase shapes in relation to date and time from 2013 to 2020. The data set also includes information on:

- Age of moon
- Diameter of the moon
- Distance between Earth and the Moon
- Rotational position of the moon

### [Austin Traffic Fatalities](/APDTrafficFatalities/APD_Traffic_Fatality_all.csv)

Austin Traffic Fatalities contains 2012 to 2019 data on location, date, time, and incedent classification on fatal traffic collisions. The data set also includes information on:

- Type of road
- Number of fatalities
- Location
- Time
- Day of the week
- Date
- If the driver was speeding
- Driver's license status

## Hypothesis

1. Moon phases have an influence on traffic fatalities. There is a correlation between specific moon phases (e.g., full moon, new moon) and an increase in traffic accidents and fatalities.

2. Days of the week have an influence on traffic fatalities. There is a correlation between weekends (e.g., Sunday, Saturday) and an increase in traffic accidents and fatalities.
